he Employee Tracker App is a modern Android application built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It is designed to help organizations manage their employees efficiently by providing a simple and intuitive interface for handling employee information. The app allows HR users to add new employees, view the employee list, update details, assign roles, and organize staff into different departments. Employees have their own dashboard where they can view their personal information, job role, and basic profile details.

This project follows the MVVM architecture along with the Repository pattern, making the codebase easy to understand, maintain, and scale. StateFlow and other modern Android components are used to deliver smooth UI updates and improve performance. The app supports two types of backend data storage: Firebase Firestore for cloud-based online data and Room Database for local offline data. This flexibility allows the application to work in different environments and makes it suitable for both learning and real-world use.

Jetpack Compose is used to build the entire user interface, providing a clean, declarative approach to designing screens such as the login page, role selection, HR dashboard, employee dashboard, and add-employee dialog. Material Design principles ensure that the UI is modern, consistent, and user-friendly.

The app is especially helpful for beginners and students who want to learn how to integrate Firebase with Kotlin, work with Room Database, and implement MVVM architecture in a real project. It also serves as a strong reference for developers exploring Compose-based UI development. In the future, the project can be extended with features like attendance tracking, leave management, push notifications, and detailed HR analytics.
